## 你好！👋

我是一名中山大学在读本科生，正在进步中！

**🌱我正在：**

- 正在摸索系统级编程语言。主修Rust中 ~~（呵呵，在C++之前学Rust的这辈子真有了）~~

**😄我喜欢：**

- 强迫症晚期，无药可救！热衷于为了完美重构一切事物，无论是代码还是现实中的任何事物。

- 喜欢数码，喜欢捣鼓，但不是合格的垃圾佬。

- 喜欢弹钢琴，喜欢玩一些动作类的单机游戏（Yes，已经掉进了ZZZ的坑里了）

**🔭我想要但还没有：**

- 提交第一个 PR

- 迭代出第一个由我自己开发的 Repository

## Hi there👋

I'm an UGRD student at Sun Yat-sen university (China Mainland), currently on the journey of leveling up!

**🌱I'm currently:**

- Exploring system-level programming languages. Majoring in Rust ~~(joking that never thought I'd learn Rust before C++)~~

**😄I love:**

- Being an incurable perfectionist! Passionate about refactoring everything for perfection, whether it's code or anything in real life.

- Playing the piano and diving into action single-player games (Yes, I've already fallen into Zenless Zone Zero)

**🔭I wish but haven't yet:**

- Submitted my first PR

- Uploaded my first self-developed repository.
